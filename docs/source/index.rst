Welcome to pass-keybase's documentation!
========================================

*pass-keybase* is a pass_ extension to create an encrypted backup of all your existing gpg encypted passwords.
Under the hood keybase_ is used to encrypt the backup.

The version control functionality (via git) of pass will also be supported by this extension.
In other words, keybase encrypted passwords will be commited to your git repo.
